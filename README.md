# Austin Texas: Weather & Crime

### We wanted to see if there are any correlation between weather and crime in this city.
According to our data, it sees that it is more likely to occur theft and burglary when it rains. It does make sense since there are less people outside which make it easy for thieves to steal without or few witness around.

#### To reach our goal, we extracted, transformed and loaded the data using PgAdmin, SQL,  and Python.
